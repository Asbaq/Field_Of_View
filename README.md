**Image Reference:** ![Field of View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62818241/201537367-0af1bf60-2a03-483f-ab7e-f586f662d5e1.png)

## Game Concept
Field of View is a tactical simulation game where players must strategically navigate their environment while avoiding detection. The game focuses on visibility mechanics, line of sight, and strategic positioning.

## Gameplay Features
- **Field of View System:** Real-time visibility mechanics with adjustable angles and distances.
- **Stealth Mechanics:** Hide behind obstacles and avoid enemy detection.
- **AI Patrol System:** Enemies patrol the area with dynamic vision cones.
- **Level Design:** Various levels with increasing difficulty and complex layouts.
- **Player Controls:** First-person or third-person movement with an interactive field of view.
- **Environmental Interaction:** Players can interact with objects to block enemy vision or create distractions.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Light and shadow affect visibility.

## Technical Details
### Programming
- **Language:** C#
- **Physics:** Unity Rigidbody system for player movement.
- **Field of View System:** Uses raycasting to detect objects and render vision cones.
- **AI Behavior:** Implements a finite state machine (FSM) for enemy patrols and responses.
- **Performance Optimization:** Uses level-of-detail (LOD) and efficient mesh rendering.

### Art and UI
- **Style:** Low-Poly Minimalist
- **Camera Effects:** Subtle post-processing for immersion
- **HUD Elements:** Simple indicators for enemy awareness and player status

## Development Roadmap
1. **Prototype:** Implement basic movement, field of view, and AI.
2. **Alpha Version:** Add levels, UI, and stealth mechanics.
3. **Beta Testing:** Player feedback and bug fixes.
4. **Final Release:** Polishing, optimization, and deployment.
